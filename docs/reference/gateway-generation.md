# Generation limits and interrupted streams

The gateway preserves caller intent across provider protocols. An omitted optional field is
not permission to select a smaller output budget or a more expensive reasoning mode.

## Output limits

Chat Completions accepts `max_completion_tokens`, `max_tokens`, or `max_output_tokens`
(one non-null spelling per request) through its protocol decoder. Messages requires `max_tokens`. An explicit limit remains a ceiling.
Admission prefers any rung that accepts the exact value. When no rung on the route does, the
limit is clamped onto the leading rung's accepted range and the change is disclosed: a limit
above the route maximum dispatches at that maximum (`max_tokens->32768(route_maximum)`; Claude
Code sends 64000 or 128000 to every model), and a limit below the route floor (16 on the OpenAI
Responses wire, or a catalog-declared minimum) dispatches at the floor
(`max_output_tokens->16(route_minimum)`). Lowering never bills more than the caller allowed;
raising adds at most the floor's few tokens. A plan account that refuses any ceiling still
narrows out instead.

## Sampling ranges

`temperature` and `top_p` outside the public bounds (`temperature` 0 to 2, `top_p` 0 to 1, never
NaN) are refused by the protocol decoder. Inside them, admission prefers any rung that accepts the
exact value. When every rung that declares the control refuses the value on range, it is clamped
onto the leading rung's range like an output limit and disclosed: Claude's thinking lanes accept
only `temperature` 1.0, so a caller's 0.1 serves as `temperature->1.0(route_minimum)` instead of
a 400. A rung that does not declare the control serves by dropping it
(`temperature->dropped(unsupported_by_provider)`), so its presence leaves the value unclamped.

## Structured output routing

A `response_format` (Chat) or `text.format` (Responses) json_schema request is a hard capability:
admission first narrows the route to the rungs whose catalog declares structured output, in route
order, and only then ranks them by how exactly they keep sampling and thinking preferences.
Otherwise a lead rung that keeps the caller's `temperature` exactly but cannot enforce a schema
would win the ranking and be refused, although a later rung serves the schema (qwen3.8-27b,
2026-10-17). When the lead is passed over the move is disclosed as
`response_format->routed(structured_output_rung)` (`text.format->...` on Responses). A route
with no structured-output rung keeps failing closed on the field. A continuation pinned to the
rung that sealed its reasoning, and a caller-pinned `gateway.routing.route_id`, never move.

## Output limits and context windows

A limit that no rung's declared context window can reserve beside the prompt (`max_tokens`
10,000,000 on a 131,072-token route that declares no output maximum) is lowered before the
window check to what the largest window leaves, disclosed as
`max_tokens-><n>(context_window)`. The prompt is sized from above for this: one token per text
byte plus a 256-token template reserve, or three bytes per token when that leaves no room. A
rung that declares no window, or that already holds the request, keeps the value. Only the
output limit changes: a prompt that alone exceeds every window is still refused with
`context_length_exceeded`.

When the caller omits a limit:

- Optional upstream fields remain absent, including Gemini `maxOutputTokens`.
- Anthropic Messages requires a numeric limit. Its adapter derives that value separately
  for each candidate from its declared maximum output, bounded further by its total context
  window when present. A context window alone does not prove a legal output parameter;
  without a declared output maximum the caller must supply a cap. The adapter discloses
  the required-field default through `x-experiential-ignored-parameters`. This is an adapter
  decision, not a numeric default promised by Anthropic or OpenRouter.
- The public request retains the distinction between omission and an explicit value.
- Accounting freezes a finite reservation bound beside each candidate's actual payload.
  An optional wire can omit its limit while reserving against a declared model ceiling.
  If neither a caller limit nor a declared bound exists, admission asks for an explicit limit
  instead of inventing one.

A total context window is not an exact remaining output allowance. The adapter does not
subtract heuristic prompt-token estimates and call the result exact. Providers still validate
combined input and output limits. Explicitly budget a coding session and compact its context
before it exhausts the model's input allowance.

The selected ceiling includes all output the provider counts, which may include reasoning.
It does not promise that every billed output token appears as visible text or tool arguments.

## Responses input lifecycle markers

Responses input messages with role `user`, `system`, or `developer` may include
`status` without an output item ID, as in the official input-message contract.
Their status does not create assistant replay identity. An assistant output
message replayed with `status` or `phase` but without its item ID (LiteLLM's
Responses bridge echoes history this way) decodes as plain assistant history:
the markers cannot anchor a replay without the ID, so they are dropped and
disclosed as `input.status->dropped(no_item_id)` / `input.phase->dropped(no_item_id)`.
Messages that carry their ID keep status and phase for exact replay.

Item IDs the OpenAI Responses API could not have issued (a client's `msg_<uuid>`,
another gateway's `item_` prefix, a non-`fc_` function-call ID) are never sent to
an OpenAI Responses rung, which refuses them. The item replays without its ID at
its original position; `store=false` means the provider resolves nothing by ID.

## Tolerated client fields

- Responses `stream_options` is accepted. The gateway never emits obfuscation
  padding, so `include_obfuscation: false` is honored exactly; `true` is disclosed
  as `stream_options.include_obfuscation->ignored(not_emitted)`, and the object on
  a non-streaming call as `stream_options->ignored(stream_false)`.
- Responses `text.format.type: "json_object"` selects the same schema-free JSON mode
  as Chat `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}`.
- Chat messages carrying GitHub Copilot Chat's `cot_id` tag decode; the tag is
  disclosed as `messages.cot_id->dropped(client_annotation)`. Its `cot_summary`, and the
  `timestamp` and `startsNewUserRequest` bookkeeping other agents stamp on messages, are
  dropped the same way, each under its own `messages.<field>->dropped(client_annotation)`.
- OpenAI's optional participant `name` on a system, developer, user or assistant message is
  dropped, disclosed as `messages.name->dropped(participant_name)`. On tool messages `name`
  still attributes the result.
- `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` is accepted and disclosed as
  `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking->ignored(not_forwarded)`: no wire receives
  `chat_template_kwargs` verbatim.
- A Responses reasoning input item with neither `id` nor `encrypted_content` cannot be resolved
  by any provider, and its summary never reaches provider history, so it is removed,
  `input.reasoning->dropped(no_id_or_encrypted_content)`.
- Codex Desktop's `internal_chat_message_metadata_passthrough` on Responses input items is
  removed, `input.internal_chat_message_metadata_passthrough->dropped(client_annotation)`, and
  its `stream_options.reasoning_summary_delivery` is disclosed as
  `stream_options.reasoning_summary_delivery->ignored(not_supported)`.
- Inline input images are accepted up to 20 MiB decoded (OpenAI's per-image limit; the base64
  text may be up to 27,962,028 characters). Narrower provider limits (Anthropic, Bedrock)
  surface as provider errors on those rungs.
- On the Messages surface a `document` block with Anthropic's `text` source
  (`media_type: "text/plain"`) joins the turn as the caller's text, title first. A content
  block of a type the surface does not define is refused naming that type.
- A control-store refusal that names no caller field (for example a model-chain release
  crossing) answers a retryable 503 `gateway_authority_unavailable`, with the store's reason in
  the worker log, instead of an unnamed 400.
- `service_tier: "priority"` (Codex Fast mode) on a route with no priority-capable
  rung dispatches at the standard tier, disclosed as
  `service_tier->default(priority_unavailable)`. Standard never costs more. `flex`
  asks for a cheaper tier, so it stays a typed refusal on such a route.

## Reasoning controls

When no rung on a route can honor a reasoning control verbatim, admission applies the
nearest servable reading and discloses it:

- `none` or `minimal` below a route's whole effort ladder (for example `low, high, max`)
  takes the shallowest tier the route serves, `reasoning_effort->low(lowest_supported)`.
  Such a route cannot turn reasoning off; other efforts still only snap down.
- A level-less enable-thinking toggle (`enable_thinking`, `chat_template_kwargs`) on a
  route whose rungs cannot reason at any depth is dropped,
  `enable_thinking->dropped(no_reasoning_rung)`. Numerical thinking budgets are never
  dropped this way.
- `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` on a route with no native Responses rung and no
  gateway reasoning carrier is dropped, `include.reasoning.encrypted_content->dropped(no_reasoning_carrier)`:
  the answer is what an omitted selector produces. Replayed native encrypted reasoning that no
  rung can read is removed from history, `input.reasoning.encrypted_content->dropped(foreign_route)`.
  A route with a native Responses rung keeps the payload and the provider judges it.

Valid explicit thinking-off settings remain off. Model families distinguish support for
budgeted thinking from support for disabling thinking. Claude Opus 5.5, Fable and Mythos
always reason: no effort level turns thinking off. On these models an explicit
`thinking.type: disabled` dispatches as the provider's own substitute for "off", adaptive
thinking at effort `low` with the reasoning withheld (`display: "omitted"`), and the response
discloses `thinking.type->adaptive` (plus `output_config.effort->low` when the request named
another effort). Clients that do not recognize the model send the off switch anyway: Claude
Code's session-title call does on the gateway's dotted aliases, and a refusal failed every one.
Any other unsupported off setting stays a typed pre-dispatch refusal (Opus 5 at `xhigh` or
`max`, Sonnet 5.5 at any effort), never a silent switch to the model's default thinking.
Opus 5.5 also cannot force a tool selection: the existing capability policy uses `auto`
only after all eligible routes decline the forced choice and discloses `tool_choice->auto`.
This does not guarantee a tool call. See the provider's
[Opus 5.5 contract](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/opus-5-5/migration-guide).

A Responses `reasoning.summary` (or its deprecated alias `reasoning.generate_summary`) is
best effort, as on OpenAI's own API. Admission prefers a rung whose wire carries summary parts over every other preference
(native Responses, or Anthropic thinking projected onto them). A route with no such rung (for
example gpt-5-nano's Azure Chat, Novita and OpenRouter lanes) serves the turn without summaries
and discloses `reasoning.summary->dropped(unsupported_by_provider)` under the caller's spelling.

An OpenAI `allowed_tools` tool choice (Chat `{"type": "allowed_tools", "allowed_tools": {...}}`
or Responses `{"type": "allowed_tools", "mode": ..., "tools": [...]}`) restricts the model to
the listed functions. A route whose every rung is native Responses forwards the selector verbatim,
keeping the full tool list for prompt caching. Any other route declares only the allowed
functions under the plain mode (`auto` or `required`, which each wire maps to its own `auto`,
`any` or `ANY`) and discloses `tool_choice->translated(allowed_tools_as_restricted_tools)`. A
`required` set on a model that cannot force tools relaxes to `auto` under the forced-choice
policy above, keeping the set. Chat lists only functions; Responses may also list the SDK's
non-function entries (`mcp`, `custom`, `image_generation`), forwarded verbatim on native routes
and matched to the declarations they name elsewhere. When nothing the set allows survives on a
wire, the choice is cleared with `tool_choice->cleared(no_serviceable_tool)`. Gateway-run tool
search narrows its corpus to the allowed set before the first round.

An explicit effort cannot be coerced upward. If a route needs a supported spelling, only an
admissible lower tier may be selected, with disclosure; a reasoning-capable route with no
admissible setting is refused. A genuinely non-reasoning route retains its existing disclosed
omission policy. Omitted thinking and effort remain omitted unless the provider protocol requires
an authored setting. A model name appearing inside a system message is not an API setting.

A caller that explicitly requests budgeted thinking without a budget receives a derived
budget that must fit the effective per-provider output ceiling. An explicit budget is not
rewritten to fit. An impossible combination is refused before provider dispatch. Numeric
Messages budgets are forwarded only to budget-capable wires, never converted into advisory
effort or adaptive thinking.

The Chat field `thinking_budget` preserves the caller's numeric control on qualified
Anthropic, Gemini 2.5, and native Qwen Cloud routes. Use it as an OpenAI SDK `extra_body`
field (or a top-level field in HTTP JSON). It is not combined with `reasoning_effort`.
The gateway translates the field name for the selected provider and discloses that
translation; it does not replace the number with an effort tier.

| Native provider route | Models | Provider control and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic Messages | Thinking-capable Claude 3.7, Sonnet/Opus 4 through 4.6, Haiku 4.5, Mythos Preview | `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`; integer >=1024 and below total output limit |
| Gemini generateContent (including native Vertex Gemini) | Gemini 2.5 Pro | `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`; 128..32768, or -1 dynamic; zero is refused |
| Gemini generateContent | Gemini 2.5 Flash / Flash-Lite and qualified previews | Same field; Flash 0..24576; Lite 512..24576; both also accept 0 off and -1 dynamic |
| Native Qwen Cloud Chat | Qualified Qwen3/3.5/3.6/3.7/3.8 and Qwen3-VL identities; GLM 4.7/5/5.1/5.2; Kimi K2 Thinking/2.5/2.6/2.7 Code | `thinking_budget` plus the model's enable switch; nonnegative integer |

Only explicitly qualified model identities and dated snapshots are admitted, not arbitrary
future families or all models sharing a brand. Qwen Cloud uses its native HTTPS endpoints;
other compatible hosts do not inherit this contract. Kimi K3 and GLM 5.3 are excluded because
they do not honor this parameter. Gemini 3 numeric-budget compatibility is not adopted;
use its effort control. A zero Chat budget must be sent without additional on/off controls
because zero's meaning is provider-specific. `-1` is qualified only on Gemini 2.5.

Chat also accepts `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` with integer N >=1024;
Messages clients use the same nested shape. The exact number travels to any qualified
provider using the fields above. Nested budgets require room below the caller's output
ceiling. Off/adaptive modes, competing budgets/efforts and unsupported additional thinking
controls fail explicitly. Budget values participate in replay identity, including zero and -1.

The gateway's output limit and reservation cover thinking plus the final answer. Qwen Cloud
models documenting `max_completion_tokens` receive the combined cap there. On models where
`max_tokens` limits only the answer when a thinking budget is supplied, the gateway sends
`max_tokens = total output limit - thinking_budget` and discloses that translation. A budget
leaving no answer room is refused. Omitted output limits are filled from the selected rung's
finite declared bound before payload freezing. Each fallback retains its own bound.

Provider budgets are targets or provider-defined limits, not a gateway guarantee of the exact
observed reasoning length. The gateway preserves the requested control and separately binds
the provider's output ceiling to its reservation.

[Gemini generateContent thinking](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/generate-content/thinking).

OpenRouter's `reasoning.max_tokens` remains unsupported on Chat. Remove that numeric
budget and select an effort, or use the supported numeric controls above on a qualified route.

## Truncated tools

Streaming tool argument fragments retain their order and bytes. Missing arguments, an empty
string, an explicit `{}`, and incomplete JSON are distinct facts.

A provider-declared output-limit termination remains `finish_reason: "length"` on Chat.
Missing arguments on that termination do not become a synthetic `{}` or a completed tool call.
Anthropic and Bedrock block-stop events do not establish a successful final stop reason;
missing-argument completion waits for the terminal reason. Nonempty valid calls can still
complete incrementally. Ordinary complete zero-argument calls remain supported.

A non-streaming aggregate omits incomplete tool calls and retains the incomplete outcome.
Clients must not execute a partial tool call from a length-limited answer. The gateway does
not silently repair arguments, regenerate the answer, or retry a length termination.

A provider's normal completed call containing `{}` is passed through. Completion is not a
promise that the call satisfies every caller-defined JSON Schema constraint or that a client
successfully executed it. Schema validity, provider outcome, delivery, and billing are separate
facts.

## Connection loss

Unkeyed Chat and Messages streams observe receiver closure while awaiting the same provider
read. Closing the response drops the upstream transport before waiting for settlement.
Periodic SSE comments keep a publicly silent stream active without restarting provider reads,
changing first-token measurements, or extending provider/request deadlines.

Closing a transport is not proof that every provider stops its own compute immediately.
Observed usage remains billable according to the host's policy. Cancellation must never erase
usage already parsed or override a provider terminal already observed. The settlement guard
retains these facts across cancellation of the owning task and delivers one decided outcome.

Keyed Chat owners retain their bounded replay contract after their subscriber leaves. A retry
joins or retrieves the same operation rather than dispatching a second generation. Heartbeat
comments are not retained as replay content. Requests without an operation key are distinct
submissions even when their prompts match; the gateway does not deduplicate unrelated callers
by transcript contents.

Some providers supply usage only at the end. A dispatched request canceled before a provider
terminal is observed carries the internal `usage_incomplete_due_to_disconnect` accounting signal
even when partial counts are known, together with the generated text observed so far
(`streamed_output`: visible text and tool arguments in one leg, reasoning in the other, bounded
with an overflow character count). When the provider had accepted the request (`opened`), the
accounting registry completes the meter with the gateway's own tokenizer: the counted prompt fills
a missing input total, the observed deltas fill a missing output total (reasoning folded in as an
output subset), an observed leg is kept when it is at least the estimate, an unreported cache-read leg is
estimated at the organization's recent cached share of input on that rung (the same settled-meter
EWMA the cache-priority term reads; zero without a live sample), and cache-write legs stay unknown
unless the provider reported an input total. The terminal then carries the internal
`usage_estimated` marker and settles at the estimated cost with `usage_source = estimated`,
releasing the rest of the reserved bound; the local gateway's monthly allocation charges the same
figure. A disconnect the provider never answered (not opened), or one on a DECISIONS request,
keeps the conservative policy: the full reserved bound consumes local budget, the provider cost
stays unknown, observed partial counts remain available, and hosted accounting retains unresolved
authorization separately from settled spend. An observed terminal with missing usage retains the
host's unknown-terminal policy; neither marker broadens it. Stopping generation is not evidence
that its unreported usage was free, and an estimate is never reported as observed.

Meter parsing follows the provider's wire contract. Missing primary counts on partial
OpenAI, Anthropic, or Bedrock reports remain unknown. Gemini's present `usageMetadata` uses
implicit-presence protobuf scalars, so omitted zero-valued counts retain Google's zero-default
meaning; thinking tokens still contribute to billed output. An absent usage object is unknown.
Cumulative reports from one generation are merged, not added. Costs from separate physical
generations cannot acquire a known total by adding a known count to an unknown one.

Chat and Responses preserve the observed `cache_write_1h_tokens` detail within total cache
writes. An omitted split stays unknown; a measured zero stays zero. Where the standard response
schema requires an integer, `usage.unreported_token_details` names any compatibility zero that
stands for an unreported meter. Its only allowed names are `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`,
`cache_write_1h_tokens`, and `reasoning_tokens`, without duplicates. A named detail must be absent,
null, or the integer zero; contradictory positive or malformed values are rejected. Native
gateway hops and SDK provider adapters restore those details to unknown before valuation.
Every relay hop must preserve this evidence. A downstream parser cannot recover observability
that an older relay already discarded.

## Gemini usage trailers

Native Gemini and Vertex Gemini routes use upstream `streamGenerateContent` SSE even when
Chat callers request a non-streaming JSON response. A candidate's `finishReason` freezes its
content and outcome, but the gateway continues reading metadata so `usageMetadata` can arrive
before, alongside, or after that finish. Later text, tools, errors, and finish reasons cannot
reopen or replace the declared answer. The final meter precedes one terminal settlement.

This metadata-only drain has one absolute allowance: the selected connection's existing body-read
timeout, measured from the decoded finish and capped by the request's remaining deadline.
Trailers and keepalives cannot renew it. EOF completes immediately, with no fixed waiting period.
A stalled transport can therefore add up to that allowance before the response finishes.
Cancellation closes the upstream without waiting for more metadata. At the hard request deadline,
public SSE delivery can close without a final client frame; settlement still preserves an already
decoded provider outcome and the meter observed so far. This guarantee starts after the finish
passes framing and normalization. The shared SSE decoder rejects an entire network batch on a
framing error, so a finish earlier in that rejected batch is not yet a decoded outcome.

Partial or empty suffixes cannot erase earlier counts. Prompt, candidate, thinking, and cache
counts accumulate independently of the last publishable meter; withholding a cache subset does
not discard output counts that arrive before input. Cumulative snapshots are never added together.
Cache counts greater than accumulated input stay pending, even when a consistent meter already
exists. A later input report promotes the greatest actual observed cache count it covers, while
larger counts remain pending. Smaller newly valid cache reports can therefore advance the meter
independently of a larger pending count. Counts are never clamped to invent a subset. The set of
distinct pending counts is bounded by the existing 4,096-entry provider-state limit; an overflow
ends the drain with the already decoded outcome and last safe meter.

Newer consistent primary counts can advance the meter without publishing pending cache counts.
A report that itself contradicts the subset relation cannot replace the last consistent meter.
Without reconciled input, pending nonzero cache evidence cannot authorize new output-only usage,
even after an empty report; previously observed output legs remain pending until input arrives.
An absent whole usage object stays unknown, and a finished all-zero report keeps the existing
unknown-meter settlement policy. An interrupted or expired drain preserves the best consistent
report, not a guarantee that the provider's final report was received. It does not trigger another
generation to recover missing usage.

This behavior applies to new requests. It does not reconstruct historical provider frames,
attribute past missing meters to a particular cause, or authorize retrospective billing changes.

## Host-authorized Google cache resources

Native Gemini and Vertex can create explicit cache resources only when the embedder supplies
`NativeControlPlane(..., explicit_cache=host)`. The default is `None`, which leaves existing
implicit caching and ignored-marker disclosures unchanged. A host must require both an explicit
five-minute ephemeral checkpoint and a configured customer-funded cache allowance; missing or zero
allowance never authorizes creation. `prompt_cache_key` alone is not a spending instruction.

The initial native path handles exact text prefixes on Google's official Gemini `v1beta` and
Vertex `v1` endpoints. It retains the marked prefix, its system instructions and supported function
tools in one cache resource, and sends the remaining content with `cachedContent`. A checkpoint
cannot move to a different prefix. Media, tool-call history, automatic/request-level markers,
interleaved instructions and other unsupported shapes retain their existing uncached behavior and
disclosures. Cache handling is skipped for body-signed requests, search rounds and repaired payloads.
ZDR requests do not create retained resources.

Vertex returns resource names with a numeric project number, even when the endpoint uses a
project ID. For those endpoints, the host supplies
`GoogleCacheAuthority(vertex_project=VertexCacheProject(endpoint_project="my-project", project_number="123456789"), ...)`
with an independently verified association for that provider account. Missing mapping skips
creation before reserving funds. A conflicting mapping fails closed. Neither the caller nor a
provider response can establish the mapping; numeric endpoints cannot be remapped to another
project. The create URL, model, region and credentials remain exactly those admitted, and only the
verified numeric namespace is accepted for creation results and reuse. Native Vertex profiles
retain the receipt of the atomically resolved service-account credential so a host can bind the
resource to that account generation. Refreshing an OAuth bearer does not replace the source receipt;
resolving a rotated service account does. This receipt does not enable static-auth cache-affinity
recovery for Vertex, including when the host declares an operational region.

Cache creation happens only after route selection and generation reservation. Rust makes at most
one cache-create HTTP request, using the selected endpoint's credentials, no redirects or retries,
and the remaining request deadline. The request sends a fixed absolute expiration no more than
five minutes away, not a sliding TTL. Response parsing is bounded to 64 KiB and exposes only the
resource name, provider-measured token count, expiration, optional creation time and status to the
host callback. `CacheResult.create_time` carries Google's `createTime` as an absolute Unix timestamp,
not a TTL or locally inferred start time. A known value is positive, finite and no later than the
reported expiration or its observation; missing, malformed or future creation facts remain `None`.
A valid resource can remain ready with `create_time=None`: readiness establishes usability, not
billing completeness. A host whose published customer schedule requires creation time must retain
its full hold until it has sufficient provider facts and may refuse accounting acknowledgement.
The provider-reported resource interval is evidence, not an exact invoice formula or proof of
provider billing granularity, garbage-collection timing or realized storage charges.

The host owns durable cross-worker claims, customer allowance, credential-generation binding and
resource-cost accounting. Its `claim` must commit the complete create-plus-storage reservation
before granting one creator. Ready resources are isolated by tenant, account generation, endpoint,
project/location, model and exact prefix. A worker-local dictionary is not a durable implementation.
Token storage is priced per million-token-hour, separately from generation/cache-write token legs;
unknown rates are not zero, while an explicitly verified zero create-input rate is representable.
The 300-second quote applies the host-authored customer schedule and bounds that authorized
reservation; it does not establish an upper bound on every possible provider invoice adjustment.

Creation timeouts, cancellations and malformed outcomes retain reserved exposure and never trigger
blind resource recreation. Known but expired resource facts still reach accounting, but the resource
is not reused. Freshness is rechecked after host I/O and again in Rust before use. A failed accounting
acknowledgement prevents generation; an acknowledged unavailable resource can use the original
payload within existing deadlines and generation-attempt limits. No warm-up generation is added.

This engine interface does not install a hosted spending policy, durable resource store, verified
price catalog or customer settings UI. Those must be implemented and tested by the embedder before
activation. Offline and loopback tests do not establish live Google eligibility, realized savings or
provider-side storage billing. No customer is opted in by installing the engine package.

## Verification boundaries

Regression coverage exercises the actual native normalizers, encoders, and served loopback
HTTP sockets. It checks partial tools, quiet disconnects, upstream close before settlement,
terminal precedence, parsed usage preservation, keyed replay, and heartbeat deadline behavior.
These tests do not establish a real provider's cancellation guarantee. A hosted rollout also
requires exact-version provider and ledger verification in its authorized environment.

## Provider routing preferences

Every surface accepts OpenRouter's documented `provider` object
([provider routing](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing)). The gateway resolves
its routing keys against the model's own rungs at admission and never forwards them to an
aggregator upstream:

- `only` keeps rungs of the listed providers; `ignore` drops them.
- `order` tries the listed providers first, in that order; the rest remain fallbacks.
- `allow_fallbacks: false` with `order` serves only the listed providers; without `order` it
  serves only the first eligible rung. A pinned rung that fails, or is unavailable, is the
  request's error, never a failover.

A rung is named by its catalog provider id (`bedrock`, `azure_openai`, `openai`, `anthropic`,
`openrouter`, ...), or by the label a host assigns through its components' optional
`provider_label` callable (a hosted platform maps a masked house lane to the name it shows, such
as `experiential_cloud`, so callers pin the name they see in `x-gateway-provider`). OpenRouter
slugs are aliases: `amazon-bedrock`, `azure`, `google-vertex`, `google-ai-studio`. A preference
no rung satisfies (an unknown name, or `only`/`ignore` excluding every rung) is a 400 on
`provider.<key>` naming the providers serving the model. `zdr` keeps its zero-data-retention
handling; `zdr` and `data_collection` are the only caller keys an OpenRouter rung receives. Any
other key (`sort`, `quantizations`, `max_price`, `require_parameters`, ...) is disclosed as
`provider.<key>->ignored(unsupported)`. `gateway.routing` (`route_id`, `allow_fallbacks`)
applies on top of the narrowed route.
