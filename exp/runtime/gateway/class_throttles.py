"""Request-class throttles on self-hosted rungs: pace, per-class cap, and the vLLM class.

A host may vouch a request class on ``AuthorizationSnapshot.priority_class``
(0 free account .. 8 top plan paid, higher first) plus optional class
throttles. Every lever here acts ONLY on a self-hosted rung: a rung whose
authored dispatch policy sets ``upstream_priority``, the operator's statement
that it is our own vLLM server (the platform projects it on Experiential Cloud
lanes only, and it already gates vLLM's ``priority`` body field in
``native_rungs``). A third-party, BYOK or tenant rung never sets it, so on
those rungs every function here is a no-op.

Which lever frees capacity:

* vLLM priority by class (``native_rungs``): the server schedules and preempts
  by class, so higher tiers really run first on the GPU.
* The per-class in-flight cap (``self_hosted_class_concurrency``): a class
  may hold at most that many in-flight dispatches on one self-hosted rung per
  worker; past it the rung sheds the request sideways, leaving GPU slots for
  other classes. This also frees capacity.
* The output pace (``output_tokens_per_second``): delivery only. The GPU still
  generates at full speed; the data plane just releases the stream no faster
  than the rate. With ``output_pace_saturation`` set it applies only while the
  rung's in-flight load is at or above that fraction of its bound.

Nothing is set by default, and an attempt with no pace serializes exactly as
before (``started_attempt_payload``).
